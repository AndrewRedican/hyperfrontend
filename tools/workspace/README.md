# @hyperfrontend/workspace

Nx plugin providing workspace-wide executors for LLM-optimized reports.

## Executors

### lint-report

Run lint across all projects and generate a compact, LLM-formatted report.

```bash
npx nx run @hyperfrontend/workspace:lint:all
```

**Output:** `lint-output.txt` at workspace root (gitignored).

#### Options

| Option        | Type    | Default           | Description                                   |
| ------------- | ------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `outputPath`  | string  | `lint-output.txt` | Output file path relative to workspace root   |
| `affected`    | boolean | `false`           | Only lint affected projects (vs all)          |
| `maxFixes`    | number  | `5`               | Number of files to suggest fixing first       |
| `failOnError` | boolean | `true`            | Exit with non-zero code when errors are found |

## Compatibility matrix

The root `LIBRARY_COMPATIBILITY.md` is derived from every publishable package's `project.json` and `package.json`. This package holds the one generator every writer of that document shares:

| Export                                  | Purpose                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `collectMatrixLibraries(workspaceRoot)` | Reads the rows: one per publishable library under `libs/` and `plugins/`, sorted by package name.         |
| `renderCompatibilityDocument(rows)`     | Renders the document text from collected rows.                                                            |
| `buildCompatibilityDocument(root)`      | Both steps in one call; what the lint rule compares the committed file against.                           |
| `refreshCompatibilityDocument(root)`    | Writes the document when its content changed and returns its path, or `null` when it was already current. |

The `lib-compatibility-matrix` lint rule checks and fixes the committed file through `buildCompatibilityDocument`; the version flow in `@hyperfrontend/package` calls `refreshCompatibilityDocument` after every bump so the regenerated document travels in the version commit.

## Future Executors

- `typecheck-report` — Type error report
- `test-report` — Test failure report
